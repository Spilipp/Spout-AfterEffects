Spout-AfterEffects
==================

The After Effects plugin for sending textures to Spout enabled apps.


### Notes
- The plugin has been compiled against the After Effects CC SDK, and has not been tested with other versions than AE CC.
- This plugin is in a very early stage and has been compiled with a modified version of Spout SDK, and may cause crashes.
- I recommend you to use the plugin only when you want to use the Spout feature or to test it, and to remove the file from the AE Plug-in folder once you're done.

Spout is currently going through a lot of work, so this plugin may not work when Spout gets updated.
I put the plugin by popular request, but i won't guarantee any support of it until Spout is in a more mature state.

Thank you
